    <p>Welcome to the SQL-Injection Capture-the-Flag exercises</p>
    <p>In this problem, you will try to login as user "bob" using SQL injection, without knowing
    his password.  Bob is actually quite security savvy, so his password is a 64 character random
    alphanumeric string, so brute-force guessing is probably not the way to solve this problem.
    FYI: the database backing this exercise is SQLite.</p>
